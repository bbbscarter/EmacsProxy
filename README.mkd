# Emacs Proxy
This is a simple fork of Sublime Proxy, which makes it work with Emacs instead of
Sublime. The original Sublime Proxy readme follows:


# Sublime Proxy

Hey,

To install:

- Build it or use the prebuilt package found in Builds (was compiled on Mac OSX
10.8 64-bit) 
- Put SublimeProxy.app wherever you want 
- Make sure original Sublime Text 2.app is in the Applications folder 
- Point Unity's External Editor setting at the Sublime Proxy app

Now whenever you click on an error line in Unity it should open up to the
correct place in Sublime Text 2! Sweet.

There’s still an issue with the implementation, where the first time you try to
open a file it gives the error:

The document “x” could not be opened. SublimeProxy cannot open files in the
“All files” format.

If that comes up just click OK and then click on the file again; it should
open. I’m not sure why it happens – seems to be something to do with Document
Types in the info.plist. I haven’t got the time to sort that out at the moment
– if anyone knows how, let me know, or fix it yourself and send a pull request
on Github.

Props to Tim Keating who got the barebones event handler setup.
